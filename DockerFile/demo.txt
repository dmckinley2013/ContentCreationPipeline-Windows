Demo



For this demo, I’ll be uploading a document into the content creation pipeline. The pipeline’s components
communicate through a message broker system that was already in place before our group started. 
Our group’s task was to build the metadata module. This module uses a fine-tuned SpaCy model to extract 
entities from the document summary. Based on these entities, our code establishes the relationships 
between them and attaches learner objects like PDFs and images. 
All of this is stored in a Neo4j graph database, creating a structured knowledge graph that connects the entities,
their relationships, and their associated content.



We should expect to see 7 messages in the dashboard queue 
One folder containing all associated components orginating from the uploaded media - which is tracked through
the content ID
Nodes being stored to Neo4j
